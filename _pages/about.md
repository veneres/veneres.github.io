**This website is still under construction.**

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.unive.it/data/persone/24991303">Ca' Foscari University of
 Venice</a> and a graduate fellow at
 <a href="https://www.isti.cnr.it/en/about/people-detail/927/Alberto_Veneri">ISTI-CNR</a>.


 I started my path in the scientific world (by chance I would say ðŸ™‚) with two works on a new visualization technique for eye-tracking data based on a project developed with a friend and colleague during my exchange period (Erasmus + project) at the Technical University of Eindhoven.


 Now, my research is focused on the explanation of the prediction made by the state-of-the-art machine learning models used for the Information Retrieval (IR) field.
 I started my first year focusing on explaining the prediction made by ensembles of decision trees (forests) for regression, classification and the learning-to-rank task. 
 Then I switched the focus to neural cross-encoders and dual-encoders for ranking and now I am investigating what they do under the hood to predict a ranked list of documents(text-ranking task).
